## 5.1.0

*API:*
- `sh` function now accepts different set of options. Most importantly it does not accept
`stdio` option anymore. By default it will be always in `stdio=pipe` mode for `stdout`
and `stderr` process streams. It will also print out results to the terminal unless `silent=true`
option given.

- `sh` function accepts also `transform` option which allows to transform output of
shell process. Usefull if we want to add prefixes to the output.

- introducing `prefixTransform` function. It is dedicated for usage along with `sh`
function as value for `transform` option.

## 5.0.0

*API:*

- `help` function as second argument now accepts only `string`, for third argument
accepts detailed help information about `options` and `params`
- removing `option` and `options` helper, now `options` will be passed always as a first
argument to the task
- introducing `rawArgs` function, which returns raw, unparsed args which were provided
to the task
- renaming `run` function to `sh`
- introducing `cli` function which exposes tasks functions to the cli


*Mechanics:*

- `options` are always passed as a first argument to the task function
- calling tasks occurs through `npx task` not `npx run` script or by calling
`tasksfile.js` directly (`node tasksfile.js`). Tasks file now behaves like a
CLI script
- to be able to call tasks from `tasksfile.js` they must be exposed by `cli`
function. Exporting tasks functions won't do the job anymore.
- to be able to call a task through `npx task`, entry to `npm scripts` must be added:
`"task": "node ./tasksfile.js"`. `npx task` always try to execute `task` npm script,
it's just an alias.
- namespaces now can have `default` task
- removing autocomplete feature, as it required too much configuration and it
seems not used by the users
- full support for `TypeScript`. Types files are included within the project. Using
`TypeScript` for `tasksfile` is possible. It just require different entry in `npm scripts`:
`"task": "ts-node ./tasksfile.ts"`


*Other:*

- renaming project from `runjs` to `tasksfile`


## 4.4.0

- source code migrated from `Flow/Babel` to `TypeScript`

## 4.3.0

- adding experimental bash autocompletion feature

## 4.2.0

*Changes:*

- introducing `help` utility function
- improving task docs generation by annotations

*Dev env:*

- improving e2e tests
- using external module `microcli` as for cli args parsing and `--help` handling

## 4.1.0

- remove log option from `run` api command
- upgrade dependent packages
- introducing `options` helper, deprecating `option`
- better printing of methods list when calling `run`

*For development env:*

- add tests coverage check
- introducing `flow` types

## 4.0.0

**Changes:**

- removing `ask` and `generate` helpers from api, to keep runjs codebase more focused about its main purpose
- dropping support for `node` < 6.11.1
- support for other than `Babel` transpilers, like `TypeScript`
- log option to run function, when `false` it does not log the command
- documentation updates
- support for `async` / `await`
- `option` helper

**Migration from 3.x to 4.x procedure:**

- make sure you have node version >=6.11.1
- if you use Babel you need to add `"runjs": {requires: ["./node_modules/babel-register"]}` config to your package.json, otherwise Babel transpiler won't be picked up
- find alternatives for ask and generate, those are not supported by runjs anymore

## 3.4.1

- changing documentation format for calling `run` without arguments (task documentation)
- changing name of the prop for documentation from doc to help
- when typing `--help` option with task run it will provide documentation only for that task (`run sometask --help`)

## 3.3.0

- migrating to `yarn`
- removing task execution logging (decoration function) as it not working well with exporting pure functions
- passing task options through `this.options` inside a task function

## 3.2.1

- fixes within handling dashed arguments when calling tasks, dashed arguments can be "spaced" by "-" or "." now, for example: `--some-argument` or `--some.argument` (#49)

## 3.2.0

- documenting tasks args when calling `run` without arguments
- presenting list of available tasks from `runfile.js` in more readable way
- passing `stdio` directly to `spawn` / `execSync`
- changing run api where now it resolves/returns null by default and resolves/returns with value for option stdio: 'pipe'. This - allows to return colours to the terminal if provided by commands outcome.

## 3.1.1

- Bug fix: pass `process.env` by default to `spawn` and `execSync`

## 3.1.0

- fixes #43 `stderr` maxBuffer exceeded error (use `spawn` for `async` calls not `exec`)
- `runfile.js` example update in README
- drops support for `node` < 4.8.0

## 3.0.0

- task name spacing/nesting, better for scaling tasks into many files
- task descriptions
- `ask` function
- handling dash arguments in tasks (for example `--test`, `-t`)
- logging tasks arguments to console when executing tasks
- fixing exit codes when task not found
- `run` function returns an output of a command now
- improving documentation
- deep code refactor, more unit tests

## 2.6.1

- bugfix: streaming `stderr` also for `async` process

## 2.6.0

- streaming output of an `async` command by default (`run` api function)

## 2.5.1

- presenting straightforward message when no `runfile.js` found

## 2.5.0

- bringing backwards compatibility with `node` >= 4.0.0 (previously `node` >= 6.0.0 required)
- `run` command in `async` mode now returns a `Promise`

## 2.4.3

- handling config from `package.json` to define a custom path to `babel-register`
- executing async commands through `child_process.span` (better `stdio` handling)

## 2.4.0

- removing watch method from api
- RunJS will fallback to pure node now if user `babel-register` not found (falling back to it's own `babel-register` before)
adding information to README: Why RunJS ? and other README update

## 2.3.0

- dropping Babel 5 support
- handling new `exports.default` after babel update

## 2.2.0

- more explicit exceptions
- handling existing `babel-register` or `babel/register` require hooks from the user package
